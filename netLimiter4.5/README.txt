Thank you for downloading the new netlimiter. This net limiter is completely designed for Destiny 2 as they have just removed the ability to use Netlimiter 4 because it checks your pc to see if it is active now. So the only thing I like to do in Destiny 2 at the moment is mess with net limiting and seeing how well I can break the game, I have attempted to make a new net limiter. To get this to work all you need to do is run the file "NetLimiter4.5.ps1" and accept the admin privileges. Then there are directions on the limiter itself. But to use it you first must enter the file location of Destiny 2 (go to Steam and click Properties, local files, then find the Destiny 2 exe and highlight it and then shift right-click it and find the copy path). Ensure you don't use the quotes when entering the file location. There aren't many fail checks to ensure you have inputted items correctly, just that there are inputted items. After you have entered the file location select which pathing you will use (3074 is UDP usually and 30k is TCP) and enter just the port for UDP because it will completely block out the data while with TCP you can limit to certain bits. And once you have entered the port for UDP press on the box to the right. Now that box can be activated with an enter or space bar to activate and deactivate. Similar to UDP, TCP has more options for ports because most ports that I watched on Netlimiter that were usable (27k, 7500, and 30k) were all TCP protocols so there are more options for that. However with TCP you also after entering in the first box the port, you must enter the limit you want to limit at. The button works the same way as UDP. The last TCP port is for ranges so like for example you can do the ranges of 30000-30001 to give more options for limiting. If you have any tips to make it better or need help please contact me on discord @dummyrock#4636. Through all my testing and trying to make sure it works, hours, I haven't gotten banned, but that still doesn't mean that there is no possibility of this happening so please use at your own risk as I will be using it as much as I can but do what you want. Please there will be other ways to do what I have done or ways that I have not thought of but I tried my hardest with the research I have done to make this work, if I need to do something correctly, please don't come with hate. This is my first real project working with networking things so there is much for me to learn, any help would be amazing because the best learning can be done from what others know. Happy NetLimiting!!!
